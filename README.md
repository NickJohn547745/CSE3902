## Sprint 5 Features
* Procedural room generation - Enter the procedurally generated area through the bottom door in the spawn room.
* Cheat codes - Unlock by pressing the keys specified in the Cheat Codes section simultaneously

## Known Bugs
* HUD should be at top of screen (at least it is in the actual game)
* Player can shoot an arrow during room transition (fix in transition state refactor
* Player sometimes disappears when moving between rooms while damaged (or allow player to move around screen during transition)
* Room transitions sometimes spawn player in tile
* Boomerang should be able to fly over "water" tiles in certain rooms
* Boomerang should return to player, not just initial position
* Map in inventory screen does not show correct doorways
* HUD not synced with some inventory items
* Map currently set to always display on HUD instead of when item is found
* Vertical doors spawn you in front of door on opposite side of the room or push you through it.
* Player can move during transition screen (still need to refactor into gameState)
* Cannot currently distinguish between types of doors. Need to add classes for door types (e.g. locked door, bomb door)
* Enemies and player can walk through some walls in some rooms (primarily bottom right, but also sometimes top right)
* Enemies do not drop items
* Top doors in procedurally generated have hitbox moved up and to the left
* Room does not save/load correctly
* Wand projectile does not collide with tiles
